      <h2>Batman Description:</h2>
      <h2>Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals,
        but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most
        superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills,
        and wealth. While most superheroes have superpowers, Batman does not. He relies on his martial arts skills,
        detective skills, physical strength, intellect, wealth, technology, and will to face the criminals in Gotham
        City. Batman is master of martial arts he knows more than 100 martial arts. His physique is incredible he can
        fight in any setting with any styles of fighting.</h2>
        <h2>Batman Reflection:</h2>
        <h2>I chose Batman as my hero because he is a person that shows true bravery and inspirational. Watching
          all the Batman movies and shows were my favorite thing to do. Batman is really important to the city of
          Gotham. He shows true character trying to save everybody and being so brave. Batman does not have any
          superpowers unlike most superheroes so it shows that he is willing to sacrfice his life for the city of
          Gotham.
